        "#PYTHON OOP\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        " - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data and methods. OOP organizes software design around objects, rather than functions or logic. It is widely used in modern programming because it provides a clear modular structure that makes programs easier to manage, modify, and scale.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        " - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of the objects, specifying what attributes (properties) and methods\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        " - Objects are central to OOP because they allow developers to create complex applications with interacting components that are easy to understand, extend, and maintain.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        " - Abstraction is about hiding the complexity and showing only relevant details.\n",
        " - Encapsulation is about bundling the data and methods together and restricting access to protect the data.  \n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        " - Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") in Python are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They are also called magic methods or special methods and are used to define the behavior of objects for built-in operations.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        " - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the child class or subclass) to derive or inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called the parent class or superclass). It promotes code reuse and enables hierarchical class relationships.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        " - Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. The word \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms,\" and in programming, it refers to the ability of a single interface or method to operate on different types of objects.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        " - In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers and getter/setter methods.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        " - A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and perform any setup or preparation needed for the object.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        " - A class method is a method that operates on the class itself rather than on an instance of the class. It can access and modify class-level attributes and is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "  - A static method is a method that does not depend on the class or any instance. It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator and does not take a self or cls parameter.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        " - Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments (number or types of arguments). In some other languages like Java, method overloading is natively supported. However, Python does not support traditional method overloading\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        " - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent (superclass). In other words, when a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters, and same return type as a method in the parent class, the subclass method overrides the parent class method.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        " - The property decorator provides a clean and Pythonic way to manage attributes, encapsulate logic, and keep code more maintainable and intuitive.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        " - Polymorphism is crucial in OOP because it promotes code reusability, flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
        " - It allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same class, providing a common interface while supporting specific behaviors in different classes.\n",
        " - It simplifies code by removing the need for multiple conditionals, making it more modular and easier to maintain and extend.     \n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        " - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes, allowing you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes are often used when you have a common base class that defines some shared functionality but also requires subclasses to provide specific implementations for certain methods.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        " - Modularity: Code is divided into independent objects, making development and maintenance easier.\n",
        "Reusability: Classes and objects can be reused in different parts of the application.\n",
        "Extensibility: Easily extend systems without modifying the core code, supporting growth.\n",
        "Maintainability: The structure makes it easier to manage and update systems.\n",
        "Encapsulation: Protects object data and ensures proper handling via methods.\n",
        "Polymorphism: Enables flexible and reusable code through different implementations.\n",
        "Abstraction: Hides complex details and provides a clear interface.\n",
        "Improved Collaboration: Promotes teamwork and division of tasks.\n",
        "Improved Testing: Easier to test and debug individual components.\n",
        "Real-world Mapping: Models real-world entities in a natural and intuitive way.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        " - Class variables are shared across all instances of the class and are typically used for data that should be common to all instances.\n",
        " - Instance variables are specific to each object and store data unique to that object.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        " - Multiple inheritance in Python refers to the ability of a class to inherit from more than one base class. This allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes, enabling more flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        " - __str__ is for creating a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        " - __repr__ is for creating a developer-friendly string representation that ideally can be used to recreate the object.  \n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        " - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class in a child class, particularly in the context of inheritance. It allows you to invoke the parent class's methods or constructors without explicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. It allows you to define cleanup behavior for an object before it is removed from memory.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        " - Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are useful in different scenarios, with @staticmethod being appropriate for utility functions and @classmethod being useful for methods that need to operate on the class itself.   \n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        " - Flexibility and Reusability: You can write code that works with objects of different types (but same interface) without knowing their exact type. This makes the code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "Maintainability: Polymorphism allows for easy addition of new types of objects without modifying existing code. As long as the new class implements the common interface (method signature), it will work seamlessly.\n",
        "Cleaner Code: You can design more modular and clean code, since polymorphism allows for a consistent interface to interact with different object types.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        " - Method chaining in Python (and in Object-Oriented Programming in general) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement, where each method call returns the object itself (or a modified version of it)\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python is a special (or \"dunder\") method that allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function. When you define the __call__ method in a class, you enable instances of that class to behave like functions, meaning you can invoke the instance directly with parentheses (i.e., instance()), passing arguments to the __call__ method.\n",
